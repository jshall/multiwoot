# multiWoot #
With the lockdown of the the _Windows Live Gallery_, and later _Google Code_ this is now the official page for the *multiWoot* gadget built for the _Windows Sidebar_.

## What is multiWoot? ##
This project was inspired by Aaron Grady's _WootGadget_. It started out as a personal project that I used to learn more about the _Windows Sidebar_ environment and to exercise my skills as a developer. Eventually, I realized that I had created something unique and released it under the title **multiWoot**.
