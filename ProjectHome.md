# multiWoot #
With the lockdown of the the _Windows Live Gallery_ this is now the official page for the **multiWoot** gadget built for the _Windows Sidebar_.

## What is multiWoot? ##
This project was inspired by Aaron Grady's _WootGadget_. It started out as a personal project used to learn more about the _Windows Sidebar_ environment and to exercise my skills as a developer. Eventually, I realized that I had created something unique and released it the title **multiWoot**.
